# Substract-Numbers
This project is part of an Advanced Programming Techniques class. 
We have to program a function that substracts numbers contained in an array as well as create a unit test for that function and calculate the test coverage.

In order to run the main program, uncomment the last line main() and run.
In order to run the unit test program, cd into folder or open vscode terminal and run 'python -m unittest test_main.py -v'.
